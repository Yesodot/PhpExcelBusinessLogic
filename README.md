PhpExcelBusinessLogic
=====================

Demo project for PhpStorm. I will use this one during the [Webinar: Version Control with PhpStorm and other IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs, October 2nd](http://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2013/09/webinar-version-control-with-phpstorm-and-other-intellij-idea-based-ides-october-2nd/) webinar.
An explanation of the project's functionality can be found [on my blog](http://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2008/03/reuse-excel-business-logic-with-phpexcel.aspx).

The webinar is on October 2nd, 2013.

Feel free to use the code in your own projects.
